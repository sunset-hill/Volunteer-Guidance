# 1. This place is called GitHub. We have an organization account here called *sunset-hill*.

GitHub is great for storing and managing content and code. Like this Volunteer Guidance repository. We can have as many repositories as we like within our *sunset-hill* account.

# 2. Please sign up.

If you're part of SHEI and need/want to store and manage content or code, then you should get yourself listed on our [people page](https://github.com/orgs/sunset-hill/people) and use this GitHub organization account. If you're not listed but need/want to be, you'll need to get one of those already listed to add you. Perhaps we'll make Carol the Owner and everyone else just a Member but for now we're making everyone an Owner with full Admin rights.

# 3. This "Volunteer Guidance" repository is for -- you guessed it -- guiding SHEI volunteers.

This README file should be kept short. Please add a new file with a meaningul filename if you want to add any new guidance.
