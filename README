# 1. This place is called GitHub.

GitHub ([Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)) is a free solution for storing and managing content and code provided it's OK that others can read it. It's perfect for several online services that SHEI needs.

# 2. We have an organization account here called *sunset-hill*. Please sign up.

If you're part of SHEI and need/want to store and manage content or code for SHEI purposes, then you should get yourself listed on our [people page](https://github.com/orgs/sunset-hill/people) and use this *sunset-hill* account. If you're not listed but need/want to be, you'll need to get one of the folk already listed to add you. Perhaps we'll make Carol the Owner and everyone else just a Member but for now we're making everyone an Owner with full Admin rights.

# 3. Accounts are used to manage "repositories".

GitHub is for storing and managing content and code. Like this Volunteer Guidance repository. We can have as many repositories as we like within our *sunset-hill* account.

# 4. This "Volunteer Guidance" repository is for -- you guessed it -- guiding SHEI volunteers.

Each repository has a README file like this one. They should generally be kept fairly short. Please add a new file within this repository with a meaningul filename if you want to add any new guidance beyond this basic info. If you need help doing that, ask one of the folk listed on [our people page](https://github.com/orgs/sunset-hill/people).
