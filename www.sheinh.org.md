The [www.sheinh.org repository](https://github.com/sunset-hill/www.sheinh.org) stores content and code for our www.sheinh.org website. The repository has the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) feature enabled. This means the content and code stored in that repository is automatically converted into a website. If you make a change to any of the content or code in the www.sheinh.org repository, the website is automatically regenerated, usually within a few seconds or minutes, and the changes will then be visible in [the actual www.sheinh.org website](https://www.sheihn.org). (Not yet of course cuz we haven't gotten to that point yet.)
